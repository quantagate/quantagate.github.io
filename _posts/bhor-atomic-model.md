**Bohr's Atomic Model** (also spelled "Bhor" in some transliterations) was proposed by **Niels Bohr in 1913** to explain how electrons behave in atoms, particularly the hydrogen atom. It built on Rutherfordâ€™s model and introduced **quantum theory** concepts.

### ðŸ”¬ Key Postulates of Bohrâ€™s Atomic Model:

1. **Electrons revolve in fixed orbits (energy levels)**:

   * Electrons revolve around the nucleus in specific circular paths called **shells** or **orbits** (labeled as K, L, M, etc.).
   * These orbits are **quantized** â€” only certain orbits are allowed.

2. **No energy is radiated in stable orbits**:

   * As long as an electron stays in a fixed orbit, it does **not emit energy** (unlike classical theory which predicted spiraling into the nucleus).
   * These orbits are called **stationary states**.

3. **Energy is absorbed/emitted only during transitions**:

   * Electrons can **jump from one orbit to another** by **absorbing or emitting a photon** of specific energy.
   * The energy of the photon:

     $$
     E = h \nu = E_2 - E_1
     $$

     where $h$ = Planckâ€™s constant, $\nu$ = frequency of radiation, and $E_2, E_1$ = energies of higher and lower levels.

4. **Angular momentum is quantized**:

   * The angular momentum $L$ of an electron in orbit is given by:

     $$
     L = n \frac{h}{2\pi}
     $$

     where $n$ = principal quantum number (1, 2, 3...), $h$ = Planckâ€™s constant.

### ðŸ§ª Successes of Bohrâ€™s Model:

* Explained the **line spectrum of hydrogen** accurately.
* Introduced the idea of **quantized energy levels**.
* Laid the foundation for **quantum mechanics**.

---

### ðŸš« Limitations:

* Couldnâ€™t explain spectra of atoms with **more than one electron**.
* Didnâ€™t account for **Zeeman effect** (splitting in magnetic field) or **fine structure**.
* Treats electrons as **particles in fixed orbits**, which is inaccurate in modern quantum theory.

---

### ðŸ§  Modern Perspective:

Bohr's model was replaced by **quantum mechanical models**, especially the **SchrÃ¶dinger model**, which treats electrons as **wavefunctions** rather than particles in orbits.

### ðŸŒ€ Visualization:

* Imagine planets revolving around the sun â€” but instead of gravity, it's electrostatic attraction.
* Only certain distances from the sun (nucleus) are allowed â€” that's **quantization**.
