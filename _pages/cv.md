### 👨‍🔬 About Me

Hey! I’m **Raye Penber**, a physicist and quantum computing researcher focused on applying the abstract beauty of quantum mechanics to real-world problems. My work blends quantum algorithms with artificial intelligence, aiming to bridge theory and application — from secure communication to drug discovery to finance optimization.

I’m currently part of the incredible team at **IBM Quantum**, where I help design quantum machine learning systems and push the boundaries of what today’s quantum hardware can do. I’ve studied at MIT, Oxford, and Stanford, and I’m passionate about making quantum technology accessible, understandable, and impactful.
